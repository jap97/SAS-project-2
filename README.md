# SAS-project-2
In this project I have used a GapMinder codebook which contains statistics about social, economic, and environmental development at local, national, and global levels. 
Gapminder contains data for all 192 UN members.
The variables used for the analysis are urban rate(Explanatory Variable), life expectancy(Response Variable), CO2 emission,alcohol consumption, employ rate(Lurking variable).
Based on the variable I have applied Linear Regression, Multiple Regression, Logistic Regression.
